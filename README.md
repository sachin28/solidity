 Our smart contract is written for car registration. 
 It can register new or used car and checks the mileage 
 and other details like previous owner etc., when we sell 
 or transfer vehicle to other person. All the details 
 of that car is stored in the block chain and can not 
 be altered. As with every registration, mileage at the
 time of registration is maintained, mapping to the VIN
 number of the car. At the time of selling car, person
 can not alter the mileage as with every registration
 the mileage is stored. In any case, at registration if the 
 previous mileage is more then the current mileage, it means
 there is a problem and the system will throw an error message.
